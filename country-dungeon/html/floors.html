    <main> <h1>Floors</h1>
        <p>
          The Dungeon consists of 4 floors, each with their own unique environments, flora and fauna!
        </p>

        <h2>Enchanted Hanging Forest</h2>
        <p>
          Do not be fooled! This gorgeous, lush forest is not all that it seems.
          This area may be more welcoming due to the more friendly species found
          around these parts, but we would like you to keep your wits about you!
          From adorable woodland creatures, to moderately dangerous packs of
          goblins, you need to be prepared for anything. This floor is only an
          introduction, and sometimes it is best to turn around and leave the
          dungeon!!
        </p>
        <h2>Monster Lake</h2>
        <p>
          You made it to the magical Monster Lake! Are you sure you want to use
          those rafts to cross? The depth of this contained, indoor lake contain
          multitudes of creatures - most of which we have never even seen! You may
          be wondering, why is there a lake in the middle of the dungoen? But you
          definitely have much, much bigger fish to... be fried by.
        </p>
        <h2>Castle Town</h2>
        <p>
          Once you make it across the dreaded Monster Lake, you'll be welcomed -
          warmly - to say the least. Although there is a castle town, you'll find
          almost no residents. Living, that is. A vile Dragon moved in a few months
          ago and everyone has either been burned or fled! Will you be able to take
          down the new big boss of Castle Town? Well, if you manage that, you'll
          have free passage onto the final floor.
        </p>
        <h2>Depths</h2>
        <p>
          So, you made it down to the depths, congratulations... are short lived
          because you are now in the lair of the Demon king. These dark hallways are
          filled with twists, turns, and the most formidable creatures in the entire
          dungeon! If you succeed in making it to the Demon King, and manage to
          defeat him, you will then be crowned as king of the dungeon.
        Will you be a benevolent savior, or take the mantle as the new Demon King?</p>

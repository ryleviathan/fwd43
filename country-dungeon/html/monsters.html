          <dd>
            You're going to meet goblins in the Enchanted Forest, and nowhere else.
            Even these pesky guys know not to venture further down! Perhaps you
            should be more like Goblins.
          </dd>

          <dt>Wulvers</dt>
          <dd>
            They may look like a large breed of dog but these beasts have an
            appetite for new adventurers. Don't be fooled by nostalgic appearances,
            that will only get you eaten!
          </dd>

          <dt>Minotaurs</dt>
          <dd>
            The monsters are half man, half bull. Do not go into their territory
            unless you're sure you can come back out.
          </dd>

          <dt>Kelpies</dt>
          <dd>
            They may look like weird, seaweed covered horses but they are monster bent
            on dragging you down to the depths of Monster Lake. Many a poor soul have lost their lives, and have never been recovered.
          </dd>

          <dt>Dragons</dt>
          <dd>
            These magnificent, scaled beasts are as massive as they are terrifying! 
            A particulary nasty Dragon has moved into Castle Town. Attempting to slay 
            this giant brute would be a gargantuan task, but you would go down in infamy!
